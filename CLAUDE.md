# Project Context

## Stack ownership (skill lane management)

Multiple skill packs are installed. Each owns a specific phase of the workflow:

- **Front-end scoping (Expand phase):** /office-hours, /plan-ceo-review (gstack)
- **Refining (Refine phase):** Superpowers brainstorming
- **Prior art (Survey phase):** prior-art-survey (custom)
- **Planning (Plan phase):** Superpowers writing-plans
- **Building (Build phase):** Superpowers subagent-driven-development, with /design-shotgun + /design-html for UI work
- **Polishing (Polish phase):** /qa, /design-review, /cso (gstack)
- **Defending (Defend phase):** second-opinion, stakeholder-pack (custom)
- **Handoff:** /document-release (gstack), handoff-snapshot (custom)

Run them in order. Do NOT use gstack's /autoplan or /plan-eng-review — they overlap Superpowers' planning lane and create conflicts.

## Wiki

This project's source of truth lives at `.planning/`. Read `.planning/index.md` before any non-trivial work. Check `.planning/handoffs/` for the most recent snapshot — another tool may have left state for you to resume from.

## Cross-tool

When usage limits hit, run `handoff-snapshot` and resume in Codex / Cursor / ChatGPT / Gemini. Each has its own schema file in `.planning/`.
