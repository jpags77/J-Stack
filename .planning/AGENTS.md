# Project Context for Codex CLI

This project uses a markdown wiki at .planning/ as its single source of truth.

## Before any work

1. Read .planning/index.md.
2. Read .planning/log.md for recent activity.
3. Read .planning/handoffs/ for the most recent snapshot — Claude Code or another tool may have left state for you to resume from.

## Phase pipeline

EXPAND -> REFINE -> SURVEY -> PLAN -> BUILD -> POLISH -> DEFEND -> HANDOFF

Respect the lane ownership from the root AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md files. Do not skip ahead to implementation when the wiki says the project is still in an earlier phase.

### Prior-art gate (SURVEY before PLAN)

Before writing or following an implementation plan, `.planning/index.md` must show `Prior-art: ✅ complete` in its Current State block. If it shows `⬜ pending` (or the flag is missing), run prior-art-survey first — use the bundled prior-art skill files, make a build/adopt/fork/hybrid recommendation, then set the flag to `✅ complete` in index.md and log it. Do not begin planning while prior-art is pending. This holds even when refinement would otherwise hand straight off to planning — SURVEY is never skipped, and prior-art runs at least once before implementation.

## Stack ownership (skill lane management)

Multiple skill packs are installed. Each owns a specific phase of the workflow:

- **Front-end scoping (Expand phase):** /office-hours, /plan-ceo-review (gstack)
- **Refining (Refine phase):** Superpowers brainstorming
- **Prior art (Survey phase):** prior-art-survey (custom)
- **Planning (Plan phase):** Superpowers writing-plans
- **Building (Build phase):** Superpowers subagent-driven-development, with /design-shotgun + /design-html for UI work
- **Polishing (Polish phase):** /qa, /design-review, /cso (gstack)
- **Defending (Defend phase):** second-opinion, stakeholder-pack (custom)
- **Handoff:** /document-release (gstack), handoff-snapshot (custom)

Run them in order. Do NOT use gstack's /autoplan or /plan-eng-review — they overlap Superpowers' planning lane and create conflicts.

## Wiki

This project's source of truth lives at `.planning/`. Read `.planning/index.md` before any non-trivial work. Check `.planning/handoffs/` for the most recent snapshot — another tool may have left state for you to resume from.

## Cross-tool

When usage limits hit, run `handoff-snapshot` and resume in Codex / Cursor / ChatGPT / Gemini. Each has its own schema file in `.planning/`.

## Work checkpoints

After significant code interactions, create a durable checkpoint before switching tasks: commit the coherent git diff, update `.planning/` with notable decisions or review output, append `.planning/log.md`, and run `handoff-snapshot`. Do not push to GitHub automatically; push only when the user asks or an explicit publish workflow is active.

## Codex role

Codex is a first-class j-stack runtime with two primary operating modes:

- **Fallback mode:** Claude Code hits usage limits or the user deliberately switches tools. Resume from `.planning/index.md`, the latest `.planning/handoffs/` snapshot, and `.planning/log.md`.
- **Review mode:** Claude invokes Codex for an independent `second-opinion` review. Inspect only the requested artifact unless the prompt asks for broader repo context, and return findings suitable for filing under `.planning/reviews/`.

In both modes, keep `.planning/` as the durable source of truth. Notable analysis, decisions, reviews, and handoff state should be written into the appropriate `.planning/` section and logged in `.planning/log.md`.

## Claude skill mapping for Codex

Claude slash commands and skills are the source names for the process. In Codex, follow the same lane semantics even when the command itself is not available:

| Claude surface | Codex behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `/office-hours`, `/plan-ceo-review` | Run EXPAND as a problem/scope challenge before design work. |
| `superpowers:brainstorming` | Refine requirements and approaches before planning or code edits. |
| `prior-art-survey` | Use the bundled prior-art skill files and web/package research where available. |
| `superpowers:writing-plans` | Produce or follow a locked implementation plan before BUILD work. |
| `superpowers:subagent-driven-development` | Keep implementation scoped, isolated, test-driven, and spec-bound. |
| `/qa`, `/design-review`, `/cso` | Treat POLISH as verification, UX review, and security/risk review. |
| `second-opinion` | Usually means Codex is the independent reviewer; produce review artifacts, not edits. |
| `handoff-snapshot` | Write a timestamped `.planning/handoffs/` blackboard snapshot before switching tools, pausing, or checkpointing significant work. |
