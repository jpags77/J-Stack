## Current State

**Iteration:** 1
**Phase:** BUILD (maintenance) — this is j-stack's own repo under continuous self-improvement, not a single EXPAND→HANDOFF pass. Engagement Context below is the standing spec; the 2026-07-10 self-audit backlog (handoffs/2026-07-10T1803-snapshot.md, N1-N18) is the current unit of work.
**Fidelity target:** C — MVP (production-ready Claude Code skill stack)
**Prior-art:** ⬜ pending — the original pipeline design predates prior-art-survey's existence and was never run against it; genuinely outstanding, not just stale bookkeeping.
**Last updated:** 2026-07-19T17:07:42Z

## Iteration Progress

Which phase steps have run in the **current** iteration. Reset all to ⬜ when the iteration bumps (session-start step 6). `[auto]` = session-start can confirm from a wiki artifact; `[confirm]` = no reliable wiki trace, so session-start asks the user and records the answer here.

## Engagement Context

**Goal:** Maintain and improve j-stack as a production-ready Claude Code skill stack — keep it lean, current, and well-structured as a reusable foundation for enterprise PoC delivery.
**Constraints:** Must remain a single-command install; no new external dependencies without clear justification; skills-as-files pattern established 2026-06-17 is now the standard.
**Done when:** Pipeline, tooling, and documentation are coherent, tested, and ready for use on new PoC engagements.
**Prior docs:** CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, .planning/ wiki, skills/ and agents/ directories.

## vision/
- [understand-anything-integration.md](vision/understand-anything-integration.md) — CLOSED: Understand-Anything integration evaluated and rejected (scope mismatch)
- [codex-integration.md](vision/codex-integration.md) — implemented design for treating Codex as a first-class fallback and review runtime via AGENTS.md + .planning/
- [handoff-blackboard.md](vision/handoff-blackboard.md) — accepted design for structured handoff snapshots with typed state, provenance, conflicts, and checkpoint policy
- [ponytail-integration.md](vision/ponytail-integration.md) — ponytail plugin integration: plan-gate decision, full level, audit findings, /goal and auto-research context
- [graphify-integration.md](vision/graphify-integration.md) — graphify on-demand knowledge graph: session-start detection, existing-repo use case, wiki convention
- [headroom-integration.md](vision/headroom-integration.md) — headroom context compression: global triggers + j-stack pipeline checkpoints
